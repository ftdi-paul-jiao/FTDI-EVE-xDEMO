0. The whole project was made and tested under the Win7 platform
   so the compile, debug, program all Windows based.

1. Execute "RunMe.bat" to build the related image, 
   and please DO read the words it gives out.

2. All the code are under the root directry of FT800, 
   others like "STM32F4", "VC2010Express", etc. 
   is compile platform related, you can ignore them.

3. This series of software is developed base on the learning from SampleApp, 
   SampleApp would have full supported function, 
   and may relatively easy be supported by R&D 
   (since SampleApp was developed by them, while this series 
   is developed by FAE).

4. You may think it's strange that why use BATCH file 
   to start related project, it's a long store, if you are interested in, 
   go doc/ReadMe_xDEMO.doc for more.

5. You may also think it's uncomfortable why not manage the related platform 
   in related directory ('src', 'inc', etc.) but hide them all in FT800, 
   still doc/ReadMe_xDEMO.doc would tell you more.
